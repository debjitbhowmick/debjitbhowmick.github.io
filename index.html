        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a Research Fellow at Monash University, in charge of key projects in an Australian Research Council funded Discovery Project, CYCLED (City-wide bicycling exposure modelling study). I aim to develop link-level bicycling volume estimation models across Greater Melbourne using multiple demand modelling techniques.
I am a joint-Ph.D. graduate from The University of Melbourne and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where I studied pedestrian movement behaviour in urban road networks, and proposed the novel concept of walk-sharing, a smarter and more sustainable way to support the safety of pedestrians and ensure a higher uptake of walking in urban mode share.
I have vast experience in analysing spatial data such as GPS and count data, data related to road networks, data visualisation and simulating mobility using agent-based simulation models. I also gained significant industry experience while working as a Transport Planner at Jacobs where I was exposed to multiple junction modelling projects spanning across the UK.
I am passionate about innovative ways to tackle modern GIS and engineering related challenges and hence, am keen on being part of a reputed organisation that is involved in major city-shaping projects.</p>
